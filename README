make build:		Builds docker container

make run:		Runs docker and builds all node dependecies int that way, that the local dependencies only exist one time in their original folder. This enables that all changes to projects are just-in-time reflected in all dependant projects. This behaviour can be seen in 'startup.sh'. Following projects are started using supervisord which restarts the projects as soon as a *.js file is edited:
	- streamup-server-demo on localhost:8080
	- streamup-teco-gui on localhost:8081
	- streamup-sensorapi-demo on localhost:8082

make start:		same as make run but starts docker as deamon

make stop:		stops the currently running docker

make rm:		removes the docker image

make shell:		starts docker with a shell open. No services are started within

make browserify:	generates APIs for the browser for 'StreamUp' and for the SmartTeco Ontology 'streamup-server-teco/src/SmartTecoOntology.js'
